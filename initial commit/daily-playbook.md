# Me Inc. Daily Playbook - Quick Reference

**Print this. Pin it above your desk. Reference it daily.**

## Morning Ritual (9:00 AM - 5 minutes)

### The Three Questions
```
1. What did I SHIP yesterday?
   [Not "worked on" - what's DONE and DEMO-ABLE?]

2. What will I SHIP today?
   [One clear, testable deliverable]

3. What is BLOCKING me?
   [If >2 hours old, pivot or ask for help]
```

### Then: 4-6 Hour Deep Work Block
- Close Slack, email, social media
- Phone on airplane mode
- Work ONLY on highest RICE item
- Ship before switching

---

## RICE Score Calculator (Use for every new idea)

$$\text{Score} = \frac{\text{Reach} \times \text{Impact} \times \text{Confidence}}{\text{Effort}}$$

### Power Law Scales
| Scale | Reach | Impact | Confidence |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Exponential** | 1, 10, 100, 1000+ | 1, 10, 100 | 10%, 50%, 80% |
| **Example** | People reached | Career change potential | Probability of success |

### Pre-Filter Question
**"Does this have 10x+ exponential potential?"**
- ✅ Yes → Calculate RICE
- ❌ No → Delegate/Automate/Skip

### Quick Examples
```
Build Resume Agent: (100 × 10 × 0.8) / 5 = 1,600 → DO
LeetCode grind:     (1 × 1 × 1.0) / 14 = 7   → SKIP
Find Co-Founder:    (1000 × 100 × 0.2) / 10 = 2,000 → DO (moonshot)
```

## The 80/20 Time Budget

### Your 8-Hour Day
```
6.4 hours (80%) → Top 2 RICE items only
1.6 hours (20%) → Everything else (email, admin, outreach)
```

### Non-Negotiables (Every Day)
- [ ] 1 green square (GitHub commit)
- [ ] 5 warm DMs sent
- [ ] 1 decision logged with reasoning
- [ ] 1 task moved to "Done" in Linear

## North Star Metrics (Check Daily)

### Leading Indicators (What You Control)
| Metric | Daily Target | Weekly Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Code commits | 1+ | 35+ |
| Warm DMs sent | 5 | 35 |
| Features shipped | 0.3 | 2-3 |
| Jobs discovered | 10+ | 50+ |

### Lagging Indicators (What You're Trying to Move)
- Callbacks/Responses (Target: 10+ by Week 4)
- First Round Interviews (Target: 5+ by Week 6)
- Final Rounds (Target: 3+ by Week 7)
- Offers (Target: 2+ by Week 8)

## Decision Making Framework

### When You're Stuck
1. What's the simplest next step?
2. Can I ship something in <2 hours?
3. Who can unblock me in <10 minutes?
4. Should I pivot to next highest RICE item?

### When You Want to Add a Feature
1. Calculate RICE score
2. Is it higher than current top item?
3. If yes, re-prioritize
4. If no, add to backlog and forget

### When Something Isn't Working
```
IF confidence dropped >50% THEN
    Log decision ("Killed X because confidence collapsed")
    Archive work (might be useful later)
    Pivot to next highest RICE item
END IF
```

## Friday Ritual (5:00 PM - 1 hour)

### Sprint Review (30 min)
- [ ] Demo what you built (actually run it)
- [ ] Did it meet definition of done?
- [ ] Update story points (actual vs. estimate)
- [ ] Update metrics dashboard

### Retrospective (30 min)
```
START doing: [What worked unexpectedly well?]
STOP doing: [What wasted time?]
CONTINUE doing: [What should we keep?]
```

### Weekly Executive Summary
```
Status: 🟢 Green / 🟡 Yellow / 🔴 Red
Velocity: [Story points completed] / [Story points planned]
Key Wins: [Top 3 achievements]
Blockers: [None / List them]
Next Week: [Sprint commitment statement]
```

## The Kill Decision

### When to Kill a Project/Task
- Confidence dropped below 5%
- Better opportunity emerged (2x+ higher RICE)
- Runway getting critical
- You're avoiding it for >3 days

### How to Kill
1. Log in decisions table with full reasoning
2. Extract lessons (what assumption was wrong?)
3. Archive code/docs
4. Immediately start next highest RICE item
5. **Do not feel guilty** - killing bad bets is a skill

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Blocked >24 Hours
```
1. Write down the blocker in detail
2. Set 2-hour timer for fix attempt
3. If still blocked → Pivot
4. Come back tomorrow with fresh eyes
```

### Interview Pipeline Dried Up
```
1. Double outreach velocity (10 DMs/day)
2. Add new job sources
3. Lower fit score threshold
4. Ask network directly for intros
```

### Feeling Burned Out
```
1. Reduce next sprint commitment 20%
2. Take full evening off (no laptop)
3. Review sustainability in retro
4. Remember: 8 weeks, not forever
```

---

## Power Law Portfolio Check (Weekly)

### Your Active Bets Should Look Like This
```
1 Moonshot (100x potential, 10-20% confidence)
2 Cash Cows (10x potential, 70-80% confidence)  
2 Quick Wins (1-3 days, certain wins)
0 Chores (automate or time-box to 10%)
```

### If Your Portfolio Looks Different
- Too many chores → You're busy, not effective
- No moonshots → You're playing it too safe
- All moonshots → You're not shipping anything

## Reminders When You Need Them

### When You're Overthinking
> "Done is better than perfect. Ship it."

### When You're Distracted
> "This is the top RICE item. Nothing else matters right now."

### When You're Discouraged
> "Every no gets me closer to yes. Keep shipping."

### When You Want to Add Features
> "If everything is important, nothing is important."

### When You're Tempted by Busywork
> "Am I making progress or just being busy?"
